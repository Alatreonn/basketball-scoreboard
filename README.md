# Description

This was done almost entirely from scratch as part of an exercise off [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com).
Styling (CSS) was not done by me but from the original author/teacher in [Figma](www.figma.com).

The project description was to make all six buttons functional and also included some stretch goals, including the one I implemented, Highlight the Leader.
